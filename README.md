First go at building a usb development board using the [ATtiny85](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATtiny85). I took a [digispark](http://digistump.com/products/1) schematic, modified it to use a [USB Male Type A Connector](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/437), two 1kÎ© resistors (where they were blank), placed components on a relatively small footprint, and set up the traces.


The ATtiny85 must be flashed with [micronucleus](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus) (occupies 2kB out of the 8kB flash) to have the ability to be compatible with Arduino's IDE (specifically to be used as a Digispark board). Micronucleus implements [V-USB](https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html) which is a software-only implementation of a low-speed USB device. Created on [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download). Project includes board (.brd), schematic (.sch), a BOM, and all gerber & drill files.

## Status:
- First order came in! Came with some pins pre-soldered, but pins weren't in the order at all :( Need to de-solder to 3D-print a case as had planned.
- Didn't come with the [USB male type A connectors](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/437)). Will have to order some more separately.
- Waiting on one more shipment of what are basically digispark clones
- ~~Just ordered a handful of the "Board with pins v1" off [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com). Will update if they work!~~
